Mapping census tracts in Pennsylvania to town names is a complex geospatial data task due to these factors:

Census Tracts: These are geographic regions defined by the US Census Bureau, typically used for statistical purposes and do not always align with town (municipality) boundaries.
Towns: In Pennsylvania, "towns" can refer to boroughs, cities, townships, or one actual "town" (Bloomsburg). The relationship between census tracts and towns is not one-to-one—tracts can span multiple towns, and towns can cover multiple tracts.
How to Perform the Mapping:

Obtain Data:
Census Tract Shapefile: Provided by the US Census Bureau via TIGER/Line Shapefiles (here).
Municipality Shapefile: Pennsylvania Department of Transportation or Pennsylvania State Data Center (here, PennDOT GIS).
Join the Data:
Use a GIS platform (QGIS, ArcGIS, or Python with geopandas) to spatially join census tracts to municipalities by overlaying the tract and town boundaries.
Example in Python (geopandas):

Python
import geopandas as gpd

# Load census tracts and municipalities shapefiles
tracts = gpd.read_file("tl_2023_42_tract.shp")  # PA state code is 42
towns = gpd.read_file("pa_municipalities.shp")

# Ensure reference systems match
tracts = tracts.to_crs(towns.crs)

# Perform a spatial join - assigns each tract to the town it most overlaps
joined = gpd.sjoin(tracts, towns, how='left', op='intersects')

# Save to CSV with tract GEOID and town NAME
joined[["GEOID", "NAME"]].to_csv("tracts_to_towns.csv", index=False)
Notes:

You may need to resolve cases where tracts split across multiple towns.
For authoritative mapping, check if the Pennsylvania State Data Center or GIS repositories provide pre-made lookup tables.
Summary Table Output Example:

Census Tract GEOID	Town Name
42003020100	Pittsburgh
42003020200	Pittsburgh
42045010600	Philadelphia
